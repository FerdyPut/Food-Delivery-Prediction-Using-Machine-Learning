## Case:
Delays in food delivery are the most common complaint from customers of food delivery services. This issue can lead to decreased customer satisfaction, negative reviews directed at both the delivery personnel and the ordered outlet, and ultimately impact customer loyalty, where customers may no longer trust or choose to place orders from the same outlet or delivery service on the platform.

## Factors:
Why do food delivery delays occur?
The timeliness of food delivery depends on several factors:

- Delivery distance: The farther the delivery distance, the longer it will take, as more time is needed to complete the delivery process.

- Weather conditions and traffic lights: Poor weather, such as rain or storms, can slow down delivery. Additionally, frequent traffic lights and traffic congestion can cause further delays in delivering the order.

- Delivery time: The timing of the delivery affects the process as well. The faster the order is delivered, the more satisfied the customer will be with the on-time service.

- Type of vehicle used: The mode of transportation impacts speed, time, and distance. For instance, using a bicycle may take longer, especially for long-distance deliveries or under unfavorable weather conditions.

- Preparation time: If the order preparation is not done on time, it will delay the delivery process.

- Courier experience: Experienced couriers are more likely to deliver quickly and efficiently. They know how to handle urgent or challenging situations and find the best way to ensure timely delivery.

## Solution:
As a data scientist, I aim to predict optimal delivery times to minimize the risk of delays during the food delivery process. This initiative is intended to support couriers in performing their tasks more efficiently and assist the company in maintaining its reputation. Customer satisfaction and loyalty are crucial factors that can enhance a companyâ€™s profitability. Therefore, applying machine learning to predict food delivery times is a relevant and strategic step. Considering the intense competition in the food delivery industry â€” with major players like Gojek and others â€” this initiative aims to help the company attract more customers, improve service quality, and strengthen its market position.

## Datasets:
- Order_ID: A unique identifier for each order. This is a categorical variable that does not have a direct relationship with the target variable (delivery time), but it can be used for grouping or tracking purposes.

- Distance_km: Measures the delivery distance in kilometers. This is a numerical variable and is expected to have a direct impact on delivery time.

- Weather: Provides information about weather conditions during the delivery, such as Clear, Rainy, Snowy, Foggy, and Windy. This is a categorical variable that may affect delivery speed, especially under adverse conditions like rain or snow.

- Traffic_Level: Indicates the level of traffic (Low, Medium, High). This is also a categorical variable that significantly influences delivery time. The higher the traffic level, the longer the delivery time is expected to be.

- Time_of_Day: Categorizes the delivery time into Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night. This variable can help identify delivery patterns and understand how traffic conditions or demand change throughout the day.

- Vehicle_Type: Indicates the type of vehicle used for delivery, such as Bike, Scooter, or Car. This is a categorical variable that likely affects delivery speed depending on the vehicle type used.

- Preparation_Time_min: The time required to prepare the food before delivery, measured in minutes. This is a numerical variable that is crucial because it directly impacts the total delivery time.

- Courier_Experience_yrs: The courierâ€™s experience in years. This numerical variable may influence delivery efficiency, as more experienced couriers are likely to deliver faster and more effectively.

- Delivery_Time_min: The total delivery time in minutes. This is the target variable to be predicted using the other features.
