## Case:
Delivery delays are a common and critical issue in today's delivery service operations. Some of the main causes include long travel distances, bad weather, and technical issues such as inadequate vehicles or other factors. For example, heavy rain or limited road access can extend delivery times. Since this service heavily relies on punctuality, delays pose a challenge that must be addressed effectively to ensure smooth operations.


## Factors:
Why do food delivery delays occur?
The timeliness of food delivery depends on several factors:

- Delivery distance: The farther the delivery distance, the longer it will take, as more time is needed to complete the delivery process.

- Weather conditions and traffic lights: Poor weather, such as rain or storms, can slow down delivery. Additionally, frequent traffic lights and traffic congestion can cause further delays in delivering the order.

- Delivery time: The timing of the delivery affects the process as well. The faster the order is delivered, the more satisfied the customer will be with the on-time service.

- Type of vehicle used: The mode of transportation impacts speed, time, and distance. For instance, using a bicycle may take longer, especially for long-distance deliveries or under unfavorable weather conditions.

- Preparation time: If the order preparation is not done on time, it will delay the delivery process.

- Courier experience: Experienced couriers are more likely to deliver quickly and efficiently. They know how to handle urgent or challenging situations and find the best way to ensure timely delivery.

## Solution:
As a data scientist, I aim to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate delivery times in order to minimize delays. With more precise predictions, the delivery process can run more smoothly and systematically, helping couriers manage travel time more efficiently. This is expected to enhance operational effectiveness, reduce the risk of delays, and provide strategic solutions to address challenges in the delivery service industry, particularly in competing with similar services such as Gojek.


## Datasets:
- Order_ID: A unique identifier for each order. This is a categorical variable that does not have a direct relationship with the target variable (delivery time), but it can be used for grouping or tracking purposes.

- Distance_km: Measures the delivery distance in kilometers. This is a numerical variable and is expected to have a direct impact on delivery time.

- Weather: Provides information about weather conditions during the delivery, such as Clear, Rainy, Snowy, Foggy, and Windy. This is a categorical variable that may affect delivery speed, especially under adverse conditions like rain or snow.

- Traffic_Level: Indicates the level of traffic (Low, Medium, High). This is also a categorical variable that significantly influences delivery time. The higher the traffic level, the longer the delivery time is expected to be.

- Time_of_Day: Categorizes the delivery time into Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night. This variable can help identify delivery patterns and understand how traffic conditions or demand change throughout the day.

- Vehicle_Type: Indicates the type of vehicle used for delivery, such as Bike, Scooter, or Car. This is a categorical variable that likely affects delivery speed depending on the vehicle type used.

- Preparation_Time_min: The time required to prepare the food before delivery, measured in minutes. This is a numerical variable that is crucial because it directly impacts the total delivery time.

- Courier_Experience_yrs: The courierâ€™s experience in years. This numerical variable may influence delivery efficiency, as more experienced couriers are likely to deliver faster and more effectively.

- Delivery_Time_min: The total delivery time in minutes. This is the target variable to be predicted using the other features.
